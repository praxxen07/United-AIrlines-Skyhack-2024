README Instructions:
The datasets required for running the code were provided externally and are not included in this submission. The code expects the datasets to be placed in the same directory as the Python files. Ensure that the dataset filenames and formats match what is expected in the code.

Instructions for Running the Code:

1. Running UA data deliverable 1.py (Problem 1)
This script solves the first problem in the assignment.
Ensure that the dataset is available in the same directory as the script, with the expected filename.

Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
"python UA\ data\ deliverable\ 1.py"

3. Running UA data deliverable 2,3.py (Problems 2 and 3)
This script addresses both Problem 2 and Problem 3.
Ensure that the necessary dataset is placed in the same folder as the script, using the correct filenames.

Run the script by executing the following command:
"python UA\ data\ deliverabl\ 2,3.py"

Notes:
1. Dataset File Paths: Ensure the dataset is in the same folder as the code files and that the filenames match the ones expected by the code.
2. Visual Output: The script produces both data analysis and visual outputs (like bar charts, word clouds, etc.).
3. System Resources: For tasks involving large datasets or models, ensure your system has sufficient resources to handle the computations.
If you encounter any issues while running the code, double-check the library installations and file paths.
